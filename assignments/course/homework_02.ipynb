Draw the external field (due to the large plates), the induced (due to the polarization of the dielectric), and the total electric field outside and inside the dielectric.  When considering the effect of the polarization of the dielectric, it will be helpful to remember that the electric field of an infinite sheet of charge is a constant and does not depend on distance: [Electric Field, Flat Sheets of Charge (gsu.edu)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/elesht.html#c1)"

Make a graph that shows the $y$ component of the electric field as you walk along $y$, starting from the bottom plate to the top plate.  Is this function continuous or discontinuous?  Griffiths states (4.3.3, but be warned it's not a super useful discussion) that the electric field components perpendicular to a surface are discontinuous by a factor of $\\sigma / \\epsilon_0$, while the electric field components parallel to a surface are continuous.  Does this match your graph? "
